**`Mary`** Donus, is the report ready?

**`Donus`** Yes, it’s on your screen:

**`Mary`** Sam, let’s get this done and call it a day, shall we?

**`Sam`** Will you please be patient and let me finish checking the configuration, i don’t want to lose another drone in this simple task.

**`Mary`** Don’t be too hard on yourself. We only lose two so far, plenty of them left.

**`Sam`** I don’t think 10 is plenty. Just give me 5 more minutes.

**`Mary`** Alright, perfectionist, i’ll take a nap then, wake me up when you are ready.

**`Jimin`** Dear Mary, i have something to tell you!  

**`Mary`** Go ahead miss Korean. (Speaks with her eyes closed)

**`Jimin`** I detect some anomalies at the north pole.

**`Mary`** What kind of anomaly?

**`Jimin`** There is a strange loss of mass in the overall volume of the planet.

**`Mary`** What do you mean by loss of mass? Like a bitten cake?

**`Jimin`** Precisely yes, there is a region in the center of the north pole where the mass is basically disappeared from the planet, there is no trace of any element to be found.

**`Mary`** Have you considered that it’s just maybe a deep crack?

**`Jimin`** It’s probably is but the data doesn’t make sense. You can look at this scanned map Donus performed, the deepness of the region is larger than the entire volume of the planet.

**`Mary`** Incredible. It looks like we got an invisible tunnel.

**`Mary`** Sam, do you think you can set the initial location of the drone to look at this first?

**`Sam`** Ok sure, I’m ready. Send me the location and I will deploy the drone there to start the mapping.

**`Jimin`** Done. The area is only about 20 km in diameter.

**`Mary`** How long will the survey take?

**`Sam`** 5 days originally, but added 2 more days due to the discovery of this anomaly. So 7 days in total.

**`Mary`** Ok, time to get some sleep. Both of you let me know when there is something coming up. Donus please keeps them company.

**`Donus`** My pleasure.

Mary steps into the elevator behind the operating dome.

**`Mary`** To my cabin, thank you.

The elevator detached and move in empty space towards her cabin at the bottom desk of the ship. A large circular structure of the ship appear above the roof. The elevator is slowly approaching the entrance and attaches itself to the cabin’s door. Mary steps out.

**`Mary`** How i love this ship. So much more convenient than last year model. Only if I can have a built-in food replicator then I don’t even need to step out of the cabin.

**`Donus`** You have a message from the command center.

**`Mary`** Is this urgent?

**`Donus`** It is a personal message from the captain.

**`Mary`** Wonderful, he always knows when I’m about to slack off. Read it to me, Donus.

**`Donus[reading captain’s message]`** 

> Mary, I need your advice, tomorrow is Timmy’s birthday and I need to
> prepare something to cheer him up. He’s been upset at me lately for no
> particular reason. Any suggestion? Get back to me as soon as possible
> when you receive this message.

**`Mary`** Right, our capable captain and his son. Looks like he thinks I am good with kid or something. Donus, send this message to the captain.

**`Donus`** Ready for transmission.

**`Mary`** Cap, you need to at least try to talk to him to find out why he’s upset at you first. Regarding the birthday, my creativity is drained, I’ll need to take a rest and will get back to you when I have some idea.

**`Mary`** Send the message for me Donus.

**`Donus`** Transmission dispatched.

Mary jumps on her bed and her room is illuminated with small little star particle flying all over. She fell asleep in a mere 5 seconds.

    [Back in the operating dome]

**`Jimin`** Do you think our operating officer is sleeping a bit too much? She can take a nap almost anywhere.

**`Sam`** It maybe new to you but that’s her loudsy signature, “sleeping beauty”. You can take a nap as well if you want, I’ll wake you up at 0800.

**`Jimin`** Nah, I will finish this analysis first, this invisible tunnel is rather intriguing. I hope it’s not a data malfunction. I’m dying for discovering something special, it’s been really super boring for the past few months.

**`Sam`** As you wish, don’t get your hope too high though. Gas giant often has deep tunnel due to extreme activity in the atmosphere plus they don’t really have a ground so technically the whole planet is a network of tiny tunnels.

**`Jimin`** Thanks Sam, but I’ll keep hoping though, at least this gives me some motivation.

**`Sam`** The drone is approaching the surface entrance, enable visual in 30 seconds.

**`Jimin`** Can’t wait. Should we turn on some music?

**`Sam`** Why not, Donus gives us some classical music.

**`Donus`** Playlist started. First song: Beethoven virus.

**`Sam`** Entering atmosphere in 5...4...3...2...1, initializing gravity stabilization, extracting first navigation checkpoint. Visual is on and welcome to the Black storm.

The whole glass dome of the operating room has changed its look to the visual input received from the drone, it can be described as like the operators themselves are flying over the planet seeing from all directions.

**`Jimin`** The drone is stabilising really well despite the huge wind speed, great job Sam.

**`Sam`** Thank you. In a few minutes the drone will speed up and start the mapping, the visual will be running in delay mode until Donus detected something worth looking.

**`Jimin`** The drone will map the entire tunnel in 2 days?

**`Sam`** Most likely yes, based on the volume report you sent me. Are you ok by yourself? I need to go out a bit.
